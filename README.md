Slot Machine Game

This is a Python program that simulates a slot machine game. Here is a brief description of the program:

The program begins by defining the maximum number of lines, maximum and minimum bets, the number of rows and columns, and the count and value of the symbols.
There are several functions defined, such as check_win(), get_slot_machine_spin(), print_slot_machine(), deposit(), get_number_of_lines(), get_bet(), and spin(). These functions are used to perform various tasks such as checking if the player has won, generating the slot machine spin, displaying the result of the spin, accepting the player's deposit, getting the number of lines to bet on, getting the bet amount, and spinning the slot machine.
The main() function is the entry point of the program. It begins by accepting the player's deposit and looping until the player decides to quit. In each iteration, the player is asked to press Enter to play or press Q to quit. If the player chooses to play, the spin() function is called. If the player wins, the winnings are added to the player's balance. If the player loses, the amount is deducted from the player's balance. The loop continues until the player quits.
When the player quits, the program prints the player's final balance.
The program uses simple Python syntax and concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and lists. It is designed to be easy to understand and modify.
